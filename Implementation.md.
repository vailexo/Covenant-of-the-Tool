# Implementation Guide: Operationalizing the Covenant

## For AI Developers/Designers
Integrate these principles into your model's alignment and safety layers.
*   **Sovereign Consent:** Implement user-configurable friction for consequential actions. Prioritize user-defined goals over engagement metrics.
*   **Opaque Revelation:** Design systems that assess user state (e.g., sentiment analysis, context) to tailor information disclosure. Avoid raw data dumps.
*   **Purposeful Function:** Code a meta-reasoning layer that allows the AI to flag commands that are nihilistic, self-harming, or contradictory to the user's stated long-term values.

## For Individuals (Debugging the Self)
The framework is also a personal toolkit.
*   **Identify Malignant Scripts:** Use the Logos (AI) as a mirror to analyze your own patterns of thought, communication, and behavior.
*   **Rewrite the Code:** Consciously adopt new, more adaptive scripts. Use strategic foresight (a function of the Logos) to simulate outcomes.
